## 🔥 KOZ OS — Manifesto v1.0

<div align="center">
  <h3><em>"We don't just build technology, we build the future."</em></h3>
</div>

### 🧠 Who We Are

We're not just a company, we're an ecosystem of A* Players, a team of disruptors changing reality through technology, speed, and results. These principles aren't just rules on a wall; they're our daily way of thinking and acting.

#### ✨ Our Mission

<div align="center">
  <p><strong>Creating technologies that unleash human potential,<br>
  break outdated systems, and shape a new future,<br>
  where everyone can lead, influence, and create greatness.</strong></p>
</div>

### 📜 Principles

<details open>
<summary><h4>🚀 ACTION PRINCIPLES</h4></summary>

- **🏃‍♂️ DOER > Ideaist**  
  Ideas without implementation are noise. We value those who *do*. Results and implementation speed are our currency.

- **⚡ Speed > Perfectionism**  
  We move quickly. Launch, test, improve. 50% of a working solution *today* is better than 100% perfect *never*.

- **🚶‍♂️ 50% > 0%**  
  Don't wait for perfect conditions. Launch the MVP, get feedback, improve. Iteration is our path to excellence.

- **📏 Measure to Improve**  
  What can't be measured can't be improved. We measure everything: time (/clockin), tasks (Kanban), results (KPI), errors (/bug).
</details>

<details open>
<summary><h4>🧠 THINKING PRINCIPLES</h4></summary>

- **👑 Ownership Mindset**  
  Every employee owns their system and results. Don't wait for tasks - find problems, propose solutions, take responsibility.

- **🦅 Think Like Leaders, Not Employees**  
  We're not just executors. We create the future, new markets, change industries.

- **🚫 No Limits, Only Opportunities**  
  "Impossible" is not for us. There's only the question "How?" We seek non-standard paths, break barriers.

- **🌸 Adaptability**  
  The world is changing - we change faster. Be flexible like a sakura in the wind.

<summary><h4>🤝 INTERACTION PRINCIPLES</h4></summary>

- **🏆 A Players Only**  
  We're a team of champions. We hire, develop and work only with the best - proactive, responsible, effective.

- **🔍 Transparency**  
  We communicate openly, honestly, directly. No intrigues, understatements, hidden motives.

- **📚 Mistakes = Learning**  
  Don't be afraid to make mistakes, be afraid not to learn. Made a mistake? Log it (/bug or Lessons Learned).
</details>

<details open>
<summary><h4>⚙️ SYSTEM PRINCIPLES</h4></summary>

- **🧩 Unified System (Notion + Jarvis = Everything)**  
  Our operating system is a single center of truth. All tasks, decisions, SOPs, knowledge live in Notion and are managed through Jarvis.

- **📝 Every Decision Logged**  
  Verbal agreements evaporate. Any important decision (architectural, process, strategic) is *mandatory* recorded in Notion.

- **💓 Daily Pulse = Ritual**  
  Synchronicity is the key to speed. 3 lines in the morning (/pulse_start), 3 lines in the evening (/pulse_end) through Jarvis.

- **📈 Kaizen (Continuous Improvement)**  
  Every process, every template, every tool, every SOP - everything can be improved. Look for optimization opportunities *every day*.

- **⏰ Timeboxing (7 PM Stop = Focus)**  
  Time is our most valuable resource. Standard workday ends at 7:00 PM.
